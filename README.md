# 1. Load Audio Data : 
This step involves loading the raw audio data from various sources like WAV and  MP3 files etc.
The data is loaded into memory and represented as a numerical arrays and then to a dataframe.
Depending on the application, pre-processing steps like format conversion (e.g., converting stereo to mono), normalization (scaling the data to a specific range), and sampling rate conversion (ensuring all data has a consistent sampling rate) might be required.
# 2. Extract Features from Audio
Feature extraction is a crucial step in audio classification. It transforms the raw audio data into a numerical representation that a machine learning model can understand.
Common audio features include: 
## Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs): 
Represent the short-term power spectrum of a sound on a mel scale, which is perceptually similar to how humans hear sound.
## Spectral Flux:
Measures how quickly the frequency content of a sound changes over time. Useful for classifying percussive sounds or transients.
## Chroma Features:
Represent the presence of various musical pitches in the audio signal. Useful for music genre classification.
The choice of features depends on the specific classification task.
# 3.
Features Extracted into a Data Frame
The extracted features are organized into a data frame, which is a tabular data structure with rows and columns.
Each row represents an audio sample, and each column represents a specific feature extracted from that sample.
This data frame can be easily manipulated and analyzed using machine learning libraries.
# 4. Split Data for Training and Testing
The data frame is divided into two sets: a training set and a testing set.
The training set is used to train the machine learning model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing. Other ratios can be used depending on the size and availability of data.
# 5. Data Split
Once split, the data is prepared for training the model. This may involve additional steps like: 
## Feature scaling: 
Scaling all features to a common range to prevent certain features from dominating the model during training.
## One-hot encoding:
Converting categorical labels (e.g., genre labels) into a binary vector representation for the model to understand.
# 6. Build Model for Classification
Various machine learning algorithms can be used for audio classification. Here are some common choices:
## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): 
Particularly effective at capturing spatial relationships between features, making them well-suited for audio tasks.
## The choice of model architecture and hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer etc.) is crucial for optimal performance.
# 7. Model Built
The trained model is ready to use for making predictions on new audio data.
# 8. Test the Model
The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set.
Common evaluation metrics include accuracy (percentage of correctly classified samples).
# 9. Testing Complete
Based on the evaluation results, the model can be further refined by adjusting hyperparameters, trying different feature extraction techniques, or even using a different model architecture.
